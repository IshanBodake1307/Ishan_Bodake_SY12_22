 OPTIMAL SELECTION OF ITEMS WITHIN A WEIGHT CONSTRAINT
 (The classic 0/1 Knapsack Problem)
 Approaches included: Brute Force (for comparison), Top-Down
                       (Memoization), and Bottom-Up (Tabulation).
=====================================================================
IN PLAIN ENGLISH:
  You're packing a bag with a weight limit. Each item has a weight
  and a value. You want the most valuable combination of items that
  still fits in the bag. You can't take a fraction of an item \u2014
  either it goes in the bag, or it doesn't. That's why this is
  called the "0/1" Knapsack Problem (0 = leave it, 1 = take it).
